# Audio processing miniproject
By Rikke Bragh Jensen

Task:
Artificial Reverberation (lecture 9)
Reverbs are artficial reverberation algorithms that mimic the effect of a certain room in a recording scenario. Music is frequently recorded in a "dry" setup with little reverberation due to the room acoustics and the impression of the sound being recorded in a certain acoustical environment is added artifically later in the process. Good reverbs are among the most priced possessions of studios and they are willing to pay high prices for them. Companies like TC Electronic, Lexicon and Eventide are famous for their reverbs. This project aims at developing a reverb based on Schroeder's classical design. The reverb should be controllable using sliders or similar UI elements.
